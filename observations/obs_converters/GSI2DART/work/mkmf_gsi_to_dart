# we need to preprocess kinds.F90.   the following works on gfortran
# 

# but if it doesn't, you can try this to explicitly preprocess F90 -> f90 first,
# and change the path_names file to include the .f90 file instead of .F90:
#
#rm -f ../enkf/kinds.f90
#/usr/bin/cpp -P -D_REAL4_ -traditional-cpp ../enkf/kinds.F90 > ../enkf/kinds.f90

../../../../build_templates/mkmf -p gsi_to_dart -t ../../../../build_templates/mkmf.template   \
 -c " -D_REAL4_" -a "../../../.." -w path_names_gsi_to_dart  # Note the "-w" for MPI build
