The following files are copied from GSI/enkf without modifications
   constants.f90
   kinds.F90
   readozobs.f90
   mpi_readobs.f90

File mpi_readobs.f90 was also copied from GSI/enkf with a slight change:

   The line "use radinfo, only: npred" is now "use params, only: npred"

   There is no module named radinfo in the jedi2DART directory

These two files were also initially copied from GSI/enkf and then heavily modified.
But, the overall strucutre of the subroutines was kept
   readconvobs.f90
   readsatobs.f90
